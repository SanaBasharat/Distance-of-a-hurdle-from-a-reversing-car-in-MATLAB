# Distance-of-a-hurdle-from-a-reversing-car-in-MATLAB
The purpose of this MATLAB project is to find the distance of a reversing car from a hurdle using MATLAB with minimum built-in functions.
The video is first coverted into a binary image using a specific threshold, and then dilation is performed. Ultimately the distance is calculated in pixels and then converted to inches.
